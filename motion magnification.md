Motion magnification techniques can be divided into two categories:
- [[Lagrangian]] and [[Eulerian]]
Because the two methods take different approaches to motion—Lagrangian approaches explicitly track motions, while our Eulerian approach does not— they can be used for complementary motion domains. Lagrangian approaches, e.g. , work better to enhance motions of fine point features and support larger amplification factors, while Eulerian method is better suited to smoother structures and small amplifications. We note that our technique does not assume particular types of motions. ![[Pasted image 20230714000919.png]]

*Comparison between Eulerian and Lagrangian motion magnification on a synthetic sequence with additive noise. (a) The minimal error, min(εE, εL), computed as the (frame-wise) RMSE between each method’s result and the true motion-magnified sequence, as function of noise and amplification, colored from blue (small error) to red (large error), with (left) and without (right) spatial regularization in the Lagrangian method. The black curves mark the intersection between the error surfaces, and the overlayed text indicate the best performing method in each region. (b) RMSE of the two approaches as function of noise (left) and amplification (right). (d) Same as (c), using spatial noise only.*
