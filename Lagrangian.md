**Lagrangian video motion magnification** works by tracking the trajectories of individual pixels in a video sequence. It does this by using [[optical flow]] techniques to estimate the motion of each pixel over time. The estimated motion is then amplified to reveal the underlying motion of the object or scene being filmed.
### The process in a nutshell:
1. First, an optical flow algorithm is used to estimate the motion of each pixel in a video sequence. This is done by comparing the pixel's location in one frame to its location in the next frame.
2. The estimated motion is then amplified by a factor. This amplification factor can be adjusted to control the amount of magnification.
3. The amplified motion is then added to the original video sequence. This results in a new video sequence that shows the motion of the object or scene being filmed in more detail.
