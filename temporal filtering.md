The temporal filtering used in Eulerian video motion magnification is typically a bandpass filter. This means that the filter only passes frequencies that fall within a certain range. The range of frequencies that are passed is determined by the magnification factor.

For example, if the magnification factor is 2, then the filter will pass frequencies that are between 0 and 1 Hz. This means that the temporal changes in the video sequence that are between 0 and 1 Hz will be amplified.
